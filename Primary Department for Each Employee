Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.



(
    select employee_id , department_id from Employee 
    where
    primary_flag='Y'
)
Union
(
select employee_id, department_id from Employee
group by employee_id
 having count(employee_id)=1
order by null
)
